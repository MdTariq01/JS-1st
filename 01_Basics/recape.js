// so far i have learned about 3 topics:- Variables, datatypes and conversion operations

// we use 2 types of variables - let and const (var is also there but it has a scoping problem)

// after that we learned about datatypes- number , bigInt , string , float , boolean , null , speacial character

// null is a special type it is a object a

// type conversion we can convert any datatype by writing it as method and the first letter must be capital
